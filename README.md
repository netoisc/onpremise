## Overview

These instructions are to allow developers and customers install 3Blades on a Linux instance. It has been tested with AWS EC2 Ubuntu 16.04 instances but should work with other ones as well. A few notes about how this installation works:

- Uses Ansible Playbook to download, install, and configure artifacts, such as docker engine.
- Docker images are pulled from DockerHub by default.
- All images communicate with each other using docker links.
- All services and data stores run in separate containers.

You could do all of this with docker-compose. As a matter of fact, the ansible playbook does use docker-compose to launch and link services. However, we enhance docker-compose with ansible to provide additional configuration options.

## Preparation

1. Launch EC2 instance within your AWS account using these requirements.

- Ubuntu 16.04 AWS AMI
- t2.Medium (2 CPU and 4 GB RAM)
- Security group with the following in-bound rules:
- Open inbound ports: 22 and 80
- SSH key for remote login
- Minimum of 30 GB of disk space, more is recommended

1. Clone this repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/3blades/onpremise

1. Install `ansible` on your **local** computer. We recommended installing ansible from `virtualenv` environment:

    $ cd onpremise
    $ virtualenv env
    $ source env/bin/activate
    $ pip install ansible

    > If installing ansible with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu), using Vagrant (VirtualBox) or other virtual machine distributions you may have to install openssl dependencies: `sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev`

1. Edit the file `ansible.cfg` to change the `private_key_file` value and use your SSH-key file name. The file should look something like so:

    ```
    [defaults]
    hostfile = hosts
    remote_user = ubuntu
    private_key_file = /Users/foobar/Documents/pems/my-ssh-key.pem
    host_key_checking = False
    roles_path = roles
    ```
You may need to add read permissions to SSH key:

    $ chmod 600 $SSH_KEY

1. Test your SSH access into EC2 instance with external ip address:

    $ ssh -i key-name ubuntu@[external_facing_ip_address]

    > Both external and internal IP addresses can be obtained from AWS console.

1. Edit the inventory file named `hosts` by changing your EC2 external facing IP address:

    $ hubserver ansible_ssh_host=[external_facing_ip_address] ansible_ssh_port=22

    > Change the SSH port if it is different in your case

## Installation

1. Configure additional values for SMTP and application secret key:

- Create a random `APP_SECRET_KEY`:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.urandom(24).encode('hex')
    'cd3bd02592195ffac2a1b36f466f096aa9ca768cd67125b8'

- `SMTP_HOST`,Â `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USERNAME` and `SMTP_PASSWORD` values are used to authenticate to SMTP service. They should be replaced with your respective SMTP configurations and are necessary to enable system notifications, including password reset emails.

1. From the current folder, run ansible playbook:

    ```
    ansible-playbook -s -i hosts full-stack-deployment.yml \
    --e "force_pull_images=yes smtp_server=SMTP_HOST smtp_username=SMTP_USERNAME \
    smtp_password=SMTP_PASSWORD app_secret_key=APP_SECRET_KEY SMTP_PORT=587"
    ```

  > The `force_pull_images` argument is only useful if there is a new version of our images and would like to force updates. In that case we have to run the ansible-plabook as before.

You'll have to wait several minutes for the playbook to complete.

## First login

1. Once the playbook completes successfully, you'll be able to login to the application. Use the following credentials

     admin@admin.com
     admin
     > Make sure you select `Remember me` option

1. You'll be asked to change your password immediately. Provide the old password and a new one, then click `Change password`.

1. You'll be logged out of the application and you'll be required to login with your new password.

     > Make sure you select `Remember me` option

The ansible script creates environment types, which set memory size for containers. If you'd like your users to launch environments with more memory, you can create new items, just changing the `Memory` parameter.

## Trouble shooting

- To re run ansible playbook, log into host and run:

    $ sudo docker-compose -f 3blades/deployment/docker-compose.yml down

- Then, run ansible playbook as you did before with new settings.
